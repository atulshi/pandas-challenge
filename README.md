# Pandas-Challenge
  For this challenge, hypothetically, I have been appointed as the new Chief Data Scientist in my city's school district. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
  As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
  
## Repo Overview
  For this challenge, new repository is created at first. Then, the repository is cloned to the local desktop. The starting code provided was downloaded into the local repository. A new folder named "PyCitySchools" is created in local repository and pushed into the github. A Jupyter notebook is uploaded into the PyCitySchools folder. The notebook contains the analysis on the top as mark-down section, and also shows the data generated for the rest results.
